## Description

This project was built with intention of learning and improving my understanding of React and Firebase. I used Material UI for the styling of this project.

It is a clone of an Instagram app that we all use on daily basis for fun and inspiration. In this project, the user can log in and add a post. Before posting an image user able to preview the image and add a caption. After uploading post will appear on the board with username, image, and caption. The user can delete posted image.
