## Description

In this project I have build a few vey basic webapps which demonstrate the functionality of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

<!-- ## Implemented solutions

• Used Gatsby for front-end to reduce page loading time and get more organic traffic due to Google rewarding high-performance websites

• Integrated Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK to build cart full functionality

• Used GraphQL to allow a merchant to fetch data, product configuration, and for the user to checkout

• Connected front-end to Google Sheets API for website content, which merchant can manage independently (due to the content being in foreign language) -->
