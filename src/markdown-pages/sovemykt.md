## Description

Sovemykt project is a mock demonstration of the first real project I build for a dropshipping business of a good friend of mine. The goal was to develop a mobile-first and very fast e-commerce website with a unique clean professional-looking design.

## Implemented solutions

• Used Gatsby for front-end to reduce page loading time and get more organic traffic due to Google rewarding high-performance websites

• Integrated Shopify JavaScript Buy SDK to build cart full functionality

• Used GraphQL to allow a merchant to fetch data, product configuration, and for the user to checkout

• Connected front-end to Google Sheets API for website content, which merchant can manage independently (due to the content being in foreign language)
