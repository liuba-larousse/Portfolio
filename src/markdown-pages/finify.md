## Description

Finify project was created by me to improve my design skills, and implement new features like submit the form and switching between dark and light modes. It is a mock landing page with a unique design, where prospect customers can submit their inquires about a future project.

## Implemented solutions

• Designed mobile-first responsive UI, developed front-end with Gatsby.

• Implemented LIGHT/DARK modes with the use of SCSS variables

• Set up email form with EmailJS and React-Hook-Form, so that customer inquiries are submitted straight to the business email of a studio
